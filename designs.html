              >Reflecting on my experience as the lead designer for Auctios, the
              journey, though challenging, offered a rich landscape for learning
              and growth. During this period, I extensively utilized Figma, a
              powerful design tool, to completely overhaul both mobile and
              desktop platforms.This transformation was pivotal, contributing to
              the success of live events, with sales soaring over $1000 per
              event.

              >The design process was intensive and required a deep
              understanding of user experience and interface design. I was
              responsible for creating and iterating designs, constantly seeking
              to align them with the company's vision and user needs. This task
              demanded not only technical skills but also a keen eye for
              aesthetics and functionality.

              However, my tenure at Auctios was unexpectedly cut short by the
              company founder as he temporarily halted work on the startup. This
              abrupt conclusion, although initially disheartening, served as a
              valuable lesson for myself. As I took time to reflect on what I
              desired in professional dynamics and the importance of clear
              communication and agreements. One of the key takeaways from this
              experience was the necessity of ensuring proper compensation for
              work.

              >Despite the challenges faced, including the lack of proper
              compensation, the role served as a significant learning
              experience, providing insights into the complexities of design
              work in a fast-paced, evolving startup environment. The lessons
              learned at Auctios were multifaceted, from honing my design skills
              and understanding the intricacies of user-centric design in a tech
              startup to navigating professional relationships and advocating
              for fair compensation. These experiences have been instrumental in
              shaping my approach to design and professional interactions,
              emphasizing the importance of clear communication, contract
              agreements, and standing firm on the value of one's work.

              >The Akafuba mobile application project marked a significant
              milestone in my journey as a designer. It was my first major
              endeavor using Figma and played a crucial role in gaining design
              experience and comfortability. The project's goal was to develop a
              user-friendly mobile application to educate Ugandan villagers
              about Tuberculosis. This objective required not only a deep
              understanding of user experience but also cultural sensitivity and
              awareness.

              >As I immersed myself in this project, I found it to be a fertile
              ground for growth and learning. The design process involved
              creating an intuitive user interface that was accessible and
              easily navigable for the target audience. It was essential to
              ensure that the design was not only aesthetically pleasing but
              most importantly, accessible and effective in conveying crucial
              health information. A unique part of this project was the main
              customer segment being, small classes taught in Ugandan villages.
              This information was set to be taught by one instructor, with
              limited resources for screen size and internet access. This led to
              key alterations in our design iterations to focus on easy to
              click, and universally recognizable design choices.
            </p>

              /></span>
              Additionally, one of the most significant achievements in this
              project was the development of a comprehensive design system. This
              system was a cornerstone in establishing consistency and coherence
              across the application. It involved developing a set of design
              principles, guidelines, and components that could be reused and
              adapted as needed. Creating this system was a complex task that
              required an increaserd understanding of design theory and much
              much practice and failure. Regardless, I took this undertaking
              mostly blind as I found the benefits it served, as a step towards
              standardizing the design process, where essential to task's
              objectives of ensuring uniformity while allowing for flexibility
              and creativity, within different environments.

              >The Akafuba project was a transformative experience. It was here
              that I first honed my skills in creating a cohesive design
              language and system, which later has become an invaluable asset in
              my subsequent projects, both for EWH (Engineering World Health)
              and outside of the organization. The experience of working on the
              Akafuba app taught me the importance of understanding the
              audience, the power of a well-structured design system, and the
              need for accessible designs. These learnings have been
              instrumental in shaping my approach to design and continue to
              influence my work today.

              design process. Ensuring that the curriculum builder website was
              user-friendly and effective in guiding users through the app
              creation process was paramount. This involved repeatedly iterating
              on the design to refine its usability and functionality. Each

              collaborative effort, to design an application that concisely and
              clearly met the needs of the user. Our primary objective was to
              create a user-friendly and informative application that would

              organize and make sense of the vast amount of information and
              requirements. This technique was crucial in identifying key
              themes, user needs, and priorities for the application. It allowed
              us to categorize data effectively and provided a clear roadmap for
              our design process. By visually arranging ideas and information,

              mentor's expertise helped me develop a more refined approach to
              problem-solving. I became more adept at identifying issues,
              researching solutions, and applying them effectively. In
              conclusion, the Zinnia Health project was a pivotal point in my
              professional development. It allowed me to not only enhance my
              technical skills in full-stack development and data visualization
              but also to grow personally by improving my ability to seek help,
              learn from others, and overcome obstacles. The skills and
              experiences gained from this project have been invaluable in my
              journey as a developer and continue to influence my approach to
              technology and problem-solving.
